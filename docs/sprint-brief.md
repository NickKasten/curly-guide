# Sprint 2 Brief

## Program Snapshot
ACM Introduces: the DevSprint program! If you are looking for resume-building developer experience with current tools in a low-stakes, collaborative, constructive, and growth-centered environment, this is the place for you! Working on a 4-week rotation between projects and workshops, students will have the opportunity to build and present up to 3 unique, 2-week-long projects. Hope to see you there learning, building, and failing with style ðŸ˜Ž

## Client Prompt
Your client is asking for a small-scale mini-game to launch on their next "state-of-art" console. The game should be simple, fun, and completable within a 2-week development sprint. It should demonstrate core game mechanics and be expandable for future updates.

## Working Goals
- Understand your player's experience: who will play this game, and what makes it fun?
- Implement the core game loop: movement, shooting, collision, scoring
- Polish the user interface: menus, HUD, and visual feedback
- Collect feedback from playtesters and iterate during the two-week sprint
- Document your code thoroughly to help future developers (including yourself!)

## Core Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
- âœ“ Player movement with arrow keys
- âœ“ Player shooting with spacebar
- âœ“ Enemies spawning from the top of the screen
- âœ“ Collision detection (bullets hitting enemies, enemies hitting player)
- âœ“ Score tracking and display
- âœ“ Lives/health system
- âœ“ Game over condition
- âœ“ Start menu and game over screen
- âœ“ Increasing difficulty over time

## Ideas for Extensions
Once you have the basic game working, here are some features to add:

### Week 1 Extensions (Polish the basics)
- Add sound effects (shooting, explosions, damage)
- Add background music
- Create visual effects (explosions, particle trails)
- Improve the sprites (replace colored rectangles with actual art)
- Add a pause menu
- Display high score on game over screen
- Save high scores between sessions

### Week 2 Extensions (New mechanics)
- Power-ups (faster shooting, spread shot, shield, etc.)
- Different enemy types with unique behaviors
- Boss battles every X points
- Combo/multiplier system for consecutive hits
- Screen shake and camera effects
- Achievements/challenges
- Multiple difficulty modes
- Local 2-player mode (see multiplayer-extension.md)

### Stretch Goals (If you have time)
- Persistent progression (unlockables, upgrades)
- Multiple levels or stages
- Enemy formations and wave patterns
- Player ship upgrades
- Online leaderboards
- Mobile/touch controls
- Procedural enemy generation
- Story mode with cutscenes

## User Stories
Write 2-3 user stories to guide your development. Focus on the player experience!

Example user stories:
- "As a casual gamer, I want simple controls so that I can start playing immediately without a tutorial."
- "As a competitive player, I want to see my high score so that I have a goal to beat."
- "As someone with 5 minutes to spare, I want quick gameplay sessions so I can play during short breaks."

**Your user stories:**

## Testing Checklist
Before considering a feature "done", test these scenarios:

### Basic Gameplay
- [ ] Player can move in all allowed directions
- [ ] Player cannot move off-screen
- [ ] Player can shoot by pressing spacebar
- [ ] Bullets travel upward and disappear off-screen
- [ ] Enemies spawn at regular intervals
