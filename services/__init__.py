Services Package

This folder contains all the "systems" that power the game.
Each file handles one major responsibility:
- input_service.py: Reading keyboard/controller input
- collision_service.py: Detecting when things bump into each other
- score_service.py: Tracking points and high scores
- game_engine.py: The main controller that coordinates everything

This is called "separation of concerns" - keeping different jobs in different files
makes the code easier to understand, test, and modify!
