"""
UI Package

This folder contains all the user interface elements:
- hud.py: Heads-Up Display (score, lives, etc.) shown during gameplay
- menu.py: Menus for start screen, pause, and game over

UI is what communicates the game state to the player.
Good UI is invisible - players don't notice it, but they'd miss it if it wasn't there!
